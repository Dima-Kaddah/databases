# Lesson Plan Databases Week 3

The lesson plan is primarily written for teachers so that they can
use examples and anecdotes from this document in conjunction with the README
and explain the concepts better in the class.

##  Topics (essentially same as the README file)
1. Normalization and normal forms
2. Transactions
3. SQL injection
4. NoSQL (with MongoDB) - How to do CRUD operations
5. Non-relational vs. relational


## 1. Normalization and normal forms

### Explanation
Goal of normalization is to reduce duplication. This is done for 2 purposes:  
* Reducing the amount of storage needed to store the data.
* Avoiding unnecessary data conflicts that may creep in because of multiple copies of the same data getting stored.

Different levels of normalization are called *normal forms*. Go over the first and second normal forms. Do not ask students to memorize this, try to make them understand instead.
### Example
See examples from `readme`
https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/blob/master/Week3/README.md#1st-normal-form-1nf-4-rules
https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/blob/master/Week3/README.md#2nd-normal-form-2nf
### Exercise

Students should split in groups and discuss how to normalize the following table ![table](https://www.guru99.com/images/NormalizationTable1.png)
5 minutes
Ask a group of students to present their idea.
### Essence
What is normalization, why we do it, and the existence of normal forms. How to normalize a table to 2nd NF.

## 2. Transactions
### Explanation
Transactions are used every day in programing. Kind of like prepared statements they only make sense when a program interacts with the database. They are not useful in the sense of providing new features but are necessary if we want to keep the data correct or *consistent*.

### Example
![transaction example](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/8RnA6wqcQxTQKJvmE7KNnhwWkWTYLXRS4lnwwpdwECLDbRoN4yEgaclhZ1pDzLi0eEHULy-_V5Lk2HkH_yFCNUa5i165WVhCR3-DvprDYem7Ai_jrP0XDSo9-L61MM4)

### Exercise

No time. There will be an exercise in the homework.

### Essence
THe students should now about the existence of transaction and have some idea of what they do and how to use them.

## 3. SQL injection

### Explanation
SQL injection is a form of hacker attack where the attacker tries to get our program to execute a query to read/write data that they should not have access to.

### Example
See examples from `readme`

For use of prepared statements some minimal codes are available here: https://evertpot.com/executing-a-mysql-query-in-nodejs/

### Exercise
https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection#/start

https://github.com/HackYourFuture/databases/blob/master/Week3/sql-injection.js

### Essence
Students know about the dangers of SQL injection and how to protect their app by using prepared statements.

## 4. MongoDb as an example of NoSQL
### Explanation
MongoDb is a document store. A document is like a record, but each document need not conform to a schema.Â  It optimizes for availability (read/write speed) and simplicity (which also allows to scale horizontally in the cloud), rather than for storage (a single truth; minimize duplication)
Different way of laying out data conceptually (also physically on disk) 
Different syntax which we discuss in example and exercises

### Example
The script [create.js](mongo-crud/create.js) launches, creates and populates a database. The documents do not need to have the same fields. Documents can have sub-documents. Show the CLI. Explain the syntax in particular `db.<collectionName>.<crudoperation>(<args>)`

### Exercise
Students find in the 4 crud.js scripts where the mongodb console calls are and investigate in [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) how to write them as database calls. 
Discuss in pairs or threes your findings. Discuss differences to the sql syntax

### Essence
1. syntax difference. like a new language
2. data model difference
3. there are many flavours of nosql database products, with different support for relations and transactions and query speeds and write speeds.
